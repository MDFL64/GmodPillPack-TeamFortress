GmodPillPack
============

This is the Team Fortress Pill Pack addon. It allows you to change into creatures and machines from Team Fortress 2.

You must have the base pack installed as well as TF2.

Download the current "stable" version from the Steam Workshop. This is the "bleeding edge" development version.

Feel free to contribute to this or make your own packs. Please model custom packs after this and the Episodic pack.
